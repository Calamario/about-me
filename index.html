    <h1>Thanks for getting to know me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Mario because my parents wanted a name that could be used in both Japan and US! <br> 
    My favorite is actually Ultimate Frisbee. I also like a bunch of other sports like Tennis, ping pong, and e-sports. <br>
    I have two pet dogs! A shiba named Luna and half-shiba, half-husky named Noctis! <br> 
    I love karaoke and my favorite color is red </p>
