# about-me
This is a project to ask a user to guess questions about me!

As a prospecting developer, I wanted to create an about me page that lets the user know more about me while practicing my coding. 

I used the .eslintrc.json given by the class of 201 in Code Fellow
I also used the reset.css from Meyers but commented out its ol, ul and li resets.
